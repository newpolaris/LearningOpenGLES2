/**
 * Compiler build setting that determines whether the framework should support OpenGL
 * emulation on Metal.
 *
 * Enabling this build setting replaces the standard OpenGL functions with alternates 
 * that will use Metal for OpenGL functionality if Metal is available.
 *
 * Disabling this build setting will leave the original OpenGL functions in place, 
 * bypassing the ability to use Metal for OpenGL functionality.
 *
 * By default, this build setting is turned on when the platform architecture supports Metal,
 * as identified by the MGL_ARCH_SUPPORTS_METAL compiler build setting. Typically, you will
 * leave this build setting with its default value (otherwise there may be no reason to include
 * this framework in your app). However, during development time, you can disable this setting 
 * to revert to standard OpenGL functionality in order to compare the behaviour or performance 
 * of this framework against the native OpenGL library.

/**
 * This capability setting indicates whether the sizes of vertex buffers should be validated
 * during rendering.
 *
 * This capability may be enabled or disabled using the standard glEnable() and glDisable() functions.
 *
 * Metal requires that all vertex buffers have a known size when allocated, whereas OpenGL permits
 * the use of an open-ended address space when drawing both indexed, and non-indexed, vertices.
 *
 * Therefore, for any vertices in memory, a temporary buffer is created and populated from the
 * vertices in memory during each draw call. The length of that buffer is determined by multiplying
 * the stride of the vertices by the number of vertices that will be accessed during drawing.
 *
 * For indexed vertices, the number of vertices used in a draw call must be found by iterating
 * through the vertex indices to retrieve the largest index value. If this capability is enabled,
 * this iteration of the vertex indices will be performed on each draw call. If this capability
 * is disabled, it is assumed that the number of vertices will be less than or equal to the number
 * of vertex indices, which is typically the case. In most common rending situations, the number
 * of vertex indices is greater than the number of vertices, and the iteration of the vertex
 * indices can be skipped by disabling this capability.
 *
 * For vertices held in an OpenGL buffer object (VBO), if this capability is enabled, the size
 * of the OpenGL buffer is validated against the length expected by multiplying the stride of
 * the vertices by the number of vertices that will be accessed during drawing. For indexed
 * vertices, the number of vertices used in that validation must be found by iterating through
 * the vertex indices to retrieve the largest index value. This validation step, and the
 * iteration of the vertex indices, can be skipped by disabling this capability.
 *
 * You can enable or disable this capability at any time by using the glEnable() and
 * glDisable() functions, and you can query the current value of this capability using
 * the glIsEnabled() or glGet...() functions.
 *
 * This capability is disabled by default. Enabling this capability can be useful during
 * development, but traversing the set of vertex indices for each draw call can be time
 * consuming and can affect performance. Therefore, you should always leave this capability
 * disabled in your production builds.

 * CAMetalDrawable instances are transient for each frame. During each frame, an instance is

 * is bound mostly by CPU throughput, but should consider disabling this capability under any

/**
 * This capability indicates whether compressed PVRTC textures should be flipped vertically
 * when loaded into memory.
 *
 * The texture coordinate layout of Metal is inverted in the Y-axis relative to the 
 * coordinate layout of OpenGL. Under the same conditions, Metal textures will appear 
 * upside-down. To avoid this, MoltenGL vertically flips texture content in memory during
 * content loading and updating, and uses inverted texture coordinates on the Y-axis within
 * shaders. This last step provides consistency regardless of whether a texture is loaded
 * or generated through render-to-texture. The same Metal shader can be used with a texture
 * that was either loaded from external content or previously generated through a
 * render-to-texture operation.
 *
 * Flipping a compressed PVRTC texture can be quite expensive because, due to the complex 
 * nature of PVRTC compression, the texture must first be decompressed, flipped in memory, 
 * and then recompressed. Depending on the size of the texture, this may consume significant
 * time and memory during PVRTC texture loading.
 *
 * To avoid this overhead when loading compressed PVRTC textures, you can disable this
 * capability using the glDisable() function. In doing so, you will need to compensate 
 * for the upside-down texture under Metal, using one or other of the following techniques:
 *
 *   - Adjust your Metal shaders that use PVRTC textures so that they no longer use 
 *     inverted Y-axis texture coordinates. This means that if you use those same 
 *     shaders with non-PVRTC textures, those textures will appear upside-down.
 *
 *   - Store your PVRTC textures upside-down in their files. This will avoid the need 
 *     to flip the PVRTC texture on loading, and you can leave your shaders unchanged.
 *     However, if you need to also use the same textures when running under native 
 *     OpenGL (as on a device that doesn't support Metal), OpenGL will render those 
 *     PVRTC textures upside-down.
 *
 * You can enable or disable this capability at any time by using the glEnable() and
 * glDisable() functions, and you can query the current value of this capability using
 * the glIsEnabled() or glGet...() functions.
 *
 * This capability is enabled by default, meaning that PVRTC texture content will be 
 * flipped on loading unless this capability is disabled.

#define GL_FLIP_TEXTURES_PVRTC_MGL						0x6007

/**
 * Several OpenGL texture formats are not explicitly available in Metal (eg- RGB), or the 
 * order of the RGBA components may be different between an OpenGL texture format and the
 * corresponding Metal texture format.
 *
 * This capability indicates whether MoltenGL should convert the data content of textures to 
 * a format that allows the RGBA components to be the same in both the original OpenGL format
 * and the Metal format.
 *
 * If this capability is enabled, when loading texture data, if an exact match cannot be 
 * found between the OpenGL texture format and a corresponding Metal texture format, MoltenGL
 * will use a Metal texture format that contains the same components as the OpenGL texture
 * format, but possibly in a different order, or that may contain additional components not 
 * in the original OpenGL texture format, and will swizzle the texture content from the OpenGL
 * components to the corresponding components in the Metal texture. Metal shaders using the
 * texture, will see the texture content in the expected RGBA components.
 *
 * If this capability is disabled, when loading texture data, MoltenGL will use a Metal texture
 * format whose pixels are the same size and structure as the OpenGL texture, preserving the
 * memory layout of the texture, and avoiding the need to swizzle the texture components.
 * Where a perfectly-matching Metal texture format does not exist, Metal shaders may see 
 * some texture content in unexpected RGBA components.
 *
 * As an example, OpenGL supports the GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA texture format, which contains
 * luminance and alpha content in two bytes (or shorts, ints, floats, etc). Metal has no
 * corresponding texture format, but does support a MTLPixelFormatRG8Unorm texture format,
 * which has the same two-byte pixel structure as the OpenGL format, but any shader using
 * it must access the alpha (A) component as if it were the green (G) component in order
 * to read the value from the texture.
 *
 * In this example, if this capability is enabled, MoltenGL will use the MTLPixelFormatRGBA8Unorm
 * texture format instead, and during texture content loading will swizzle the alpha component
 * component from the GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA content into the alpha component of the 
 * MTLPixelFormatRGBA8Unorm format, and will swizzle the luminance component of the 
 * GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA content into all three of the RGB values of MTLPixelFormatRGBA8Unorm 
 * texture. Once completed, Metal shaders using the texture will see the luminance and alpha
 * content in the same RGBA components that the OpenGL shaders do.
 *
 * Swizzling is easier and more transparent than having to modify your Metal shaders to read
 * content from different components, but does increase the overhead during texture loading. 
 * This overhead appears as CPU effort to perform the swizzle, and in the case where the size
 * of the pixels is not the same (as in the above example), may increase the memory footprint
 * of the texture.
 *
 * This capability is initially enabled, indicating that when it can't find an exact match
 * between texture formats, MoltenGL will swizzle the OpenGL texture content into a Metal 
 * texture format that preserves the RGBA component access.

 * To guard against the CPU overwriting these consumable resources before they are consumed

 * until the GPU has finished with the resource.
 *
 * In order to allow the CPU to continue processing the current rendering loop while the GPU
 * is consuming the content of a previous rendering loop, these consumable resources can be
 * maintained in a pool, so that the CPU can be filling one consumable resource while the GPU
 * is consuming another. At the same time, if the CPU is consistently filling resources faster
 * than the GPU is consuming them, we don't want an ever-growing pool of resources in memory.
 * To avoid that, thie function can be used to set a limit to the size of the resource pools,
 * which sets the maximum number of copies of each consumable resource that will be allocated.
 *
 * This function defines how large the pool will be for each consumable resource. If count is
 * set to 1, only one copy of each consumable resource will exist, and the CPU will wait at the
 * beginning of each rendering loop until the GPU has consumed the resources from the previous 
 * render loop before the CPU begins filling the resources with content for the new rendering loop.
 *
 * If count is set to a value greater than one a pool of multiple copies of each consumable 
 * resource will be allocated, and these resources will be cycled through to allow the CPU to
 * continue to add content to the resources while the GPU is consuming previously added content.
 * If the CPU gets far enough ahead of the GPU that the pool for each consumable resource has
 * been exhausted, the CPU will wait at the beginning of the next rendering loop until the GPU
 * has consumed enough content that the CPU can fill the resources for the new rendering loop.
 *
 * The inital value of count is 3, which should be sufficient for most applications. For simple
 * applications, where all content is easily rendered within the timeframe of a single render
 * frame, you can reduce the count to save the allocation of unnecessary resources in the pools.
 * For more complex applications, where rendering occurs in bursts of CPU activity, you may 
 * consider increasing the count to allow the CPU to be able to move well ahead of the GPU.
 *
 * If you wish to change this value, you must do this after the OpenGL context has been created,
 * but before the first draw call is made. Changing the value of this property in the middle 
 * of a rendering loop may result in undefined behaviour.
 *

#pragma mark Shaders

/**
 * Sets the language for any shader source code that will be submitted to the 
 * glShaderSource() function.
 *
 * The language parameter may be one of the following:
 *   - GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_IGNORE
 *   - GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_GLSL
 *   - GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL
 *   - GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_AUTO
 *   - GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL_FUNC
 *
 * If the language parameter is set to GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_IGNORE, shader source code will
 * be ignored, and not compiled. If the language parameter is set to GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_GLSL,
 * the shader source code will be taken to contain only GLSL code, and when Metal is active,
 * the GLSL code will be converted to the Metal Shading Language before compiling. If the 
 * language parameter is GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL, the shader source code will be taken
 * to contain only Metal Shader Language source code, and if Metal is active, it will be
 * compiled and used. If the language parameter is GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_AUTO, the shader 
 * source code is taken to contain either, or both, GLSL and Metal Shading Language source code.
 * If the language parameter is GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL_FUNC, the shader source code
 * is taken to contain only the name of a pre-compiled Metal shader function from the shader
 * library that is currently bound to the context, which in most cases is the default Metal
 * shader library.
 *
 * If the language parameter is GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_AUTO, MoltenGL will use certain heuristics
 * to determine the type of source code that is submitted to the glShaderSource() function. 
 * When parsing starts, source code is assumed to contain GLSL format.
 *
 * When the parser encounters any of the following directives, any source code that follows
 * is taken to contain Metal Shading Language format:
 *   - #include <metal_stdlib>
 *   - using namespace
 *   - #pragma MoltenGL language Metal
 *
 * Similarly, when the parser encounters the following directive, any source code that
 * follows is taken to contain GLSL format:
 *   - #pragma MoltenGL language GLSL
 *
 * And when the parser encounters the following directive, any source code that follows
 * is taken to be used by both GLSL and MSL:
 *   - #pragma MoltenGL language All
 *
 * It is therefore possible, in a single call to glShaderSource(), to submit shader source
 * code that contains BOTH GLSL and the Metal Shading Language, and have it separated, and
 * each used where appropriate. This allows you to use the same call, and load the same 
 * shader source code, regardless of whether Metal is available on the system. MoltenGL will
 * automatically use the appropriate shader language.
 *
 * On systems that support Metal, if shader source code in the Metal Shading Language form
 * has been submitted to the shader, it will be compiled directly. If only GLSL has been
 * submitted to the shader, it will be automatically converted to Metal Shading Language
 * form, and compiled.
 *
 * On systems that do not support Metal, only the GLSL portion of source code submitted to
 * the shader will be compiled and used by the shader.
 *
 * If the language parameter is GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL_FUNC, the shader source may
 * contain comments and whitespace, but the only other content shold be the name of a
 * pre-compiled Metal function from the currently-bound shader library, which in most cases,
 * this will be the default shader library.
 *
 * The GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LANG_METAL_FUNC selection effectively performs the same operation
 * as the glShaderFunctionMGL() function, and may be used in place of the glShaderFunctionMGL(),
 * when you are unable to use that function for some reason (such as with a 3rd party library)
 * but are able to establish the content of the shader source that is submitted to the
 * OpenGL environment through the glShaderSource() function.
